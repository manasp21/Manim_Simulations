# Creative Art Project

This project demonstrates how to create artistic and creative animations using Manim.

## Scenes

1. [Fractals](fractals.py) - Generating fractal patterns and animations
2. [Generative Art](generative_art.py) - Creating algorithmic art and patterns
3. [Logo Animation](logo_animation.py) - Animating logo designs and brand elements
4. [Music Visualization](music_visualization.py) - Creating visualizations synchronized with music
5. [Abstract Art](abstract_art.py) - Exploring abstract art concepts and animations

## Usage

To run any of these scenes, use the following command:

```bash
manim -pql fractals.py Fractals
```

Replace `fractals.py` and `Fractals` with the appropriate file and class names.
