# Educational Content Project

This project demonstrates how to create educational animations for teaching various subjects using Manim.

## Scenes

1. [Algebra Basics](algebra_basics.py) - Visualizing algebraic concepts and equations
2. [Geometry Fundamentals](geometry_fundamentals.py) - Exploring geometric shapes and properties
3. [Calculus Introduction](calculus_introduction.py) - Introducing limits, derivatives, and integrals
4. [Chemistry Molecules](chemistry_molecules.py) - Visualizing molecular structures and reactions
5. [Biology Cells](biology_cells.py) - Animating cell structures and biological processes

## Usage

To run any of these scenes, use the following command:

```bash
manim -pql algebra_basics.py AlgebraBasics
```

Replace `algebra_basics.py` and `AlgebraBasics` with the appropriate file and class names.
