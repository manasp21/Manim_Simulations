    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Control animation timing with different rate functions\n",
    "- Create animations with varying run times\n",
    "- Apply lag ratios to coordinate multiple animations\n",
    "- Understand and use advanced animation techniques for precise control\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting this tutorial, you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Have completed the beginner and intermediate tutorials\n",
    "- Understand basic Manim scene structure\n",
    "- Be familiar with creating and animating mobjects\n",
    "- Have experience with basic animations like `Create`, `Write`, and `Transform`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll explore advanced animation techniques that give you precise control over timing and coordination of your animations. We'll learn about rate functions that control how animations progress over time, how to set different run times for different animations, and how to coordinate multiple animations with lag ratios.\n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques are essential for creating professional-quality animations that flow smoothly and emphasize the right elements at the right time.\n",
